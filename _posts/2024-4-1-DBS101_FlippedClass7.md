# Relational database from scractch.
Building a relational database from scratch offers organizations the flexibility, control, performance optimization, integration capabilities, and customization required to meet their specific data management needs.

There are various stages involved in creating a relational database from scratch. This is a general overview of the procedure:

1. Define the purpose and scope of the database.
    - Defining the purpose and scope of a database is the critical first step in building any relational database.

    Scope: The scope of the database outlines the boundaries of its functionality and the types of data it manages.

    Purpose: The purpose of a database is to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently to support the needs of an organization or application.

2. Design the database schema.
    - The schema is the blueprint for the database and defines the structure of the tables, fields, and relationships. Designing the database schema is essential for creating a robust, efficient, and scalable database system that meets the needs of the application and its users.


3. Choose a database management system (DBMS).
    - A DBMS is software that manages the database, and there are many options available such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. Selecting the right DBMS requires careful consideration of various factors such as data model support, scalability, performance, reliability, security, cost, ease of use, ecosystem, compliance, and future growth.

4. Create the database and tables.
    - Creating the database and tables is essential for establishing the foundational structure of the relational database system, organizing and storing data effectively, defining data relationships, facilitating data manipulation operations, ensuring data integrity, and enabling efficient data access and retrieval.

5. Define the relationships between tables.
    - Defining relationships between tables is fundamental to the design and implementation of a relational database. It ensures data integrity, consistency, and efficiency, while also supporting data modeling, analysis, and application development efforts. 


6. Populate the tables with data.
    - Populating tables with data is a critical step in the database development lifecycle. It supports testing, development, performance tuning, integration, user acceptance, data analysis, compliance, and training activities, ensuring that the application meets its objectives and stakeholders' requirements.

7. Create indexes.
    - Creating indexes is essential for optimizing query performance, improving data retrieval efficiency, supporting concurrency control, enforcing constraints, optimizing query plans, and enhancing the scalability and performance of database-driven applications.

    - Because they enable quicker searches, effective sorting, better join operations, less disk , query plan optimization, and improved concurrency control, indexes are essential for enhancing database performance. Indexes let the database engine run queries more quickly by granting fast access to data subsets. This improves the responsiveness and overall performance of the system.

8. Test the database
    - By following these testing practices, we can ensure that the database meets quality standards, performs optimally, and fulfills the requirements of its users.


Making it short,  the process of building a relational database from scratch involves careful planning, design, implementation, and testing to create a database system that effectively manages data and meets the needs of its users and stakeholders. Each stage contributes to the development of a robust and efficient database solution, supporting the organization's objectives and facilitating data-driven decision-making. It also concludes all the things we have learned till date.

# What we did during Flipped class
During this flipped class we were instructed to do the practical 7 and exercise first and to write a journal on it. Within the given time period we did practical 7 and exercise. It was solely based on self learning as we had to go through articles to exercise. It was also a new approach and it was difficult to start but in the end we got what we were doing.
