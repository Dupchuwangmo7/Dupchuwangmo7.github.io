## Database User and Administrator


# What I learned during flipped class 

Database users are grouped into various types mainly based on their interaction with the database system, roles and responsibilities.

First, we have an Administrator (DBA). These users have a heavy responsibility to manage the database system and control the 3 levels of the database. DBA also performs the task of installing and configuring the software of the database, managing security, monitoring performance of the database and also ensuring data integrity and backup.

Roles and responsibilities of DBA. 
Their roles are involved significantly with the advent of cloud computing. They also manage the relation between database vendors and service providers. DBA has to take up a role to act as technical support to end users and other IT staff regarding database issues. They ensure that databases are optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Second, Naive / Parametric End Users. They are the users with minimal database knowledge about how the database system works but they use user-friendly interfaces provided by the database application to access and manipulate the data. Providing training and support resources according to their level of expertise can help them navigate the database environment efficiently and perform their task accurately. 

Third, Developers. They are the one to create structure, design and implement database applications. They gather information depending on the requirements of the database such as layout, cost, looks and database functioning, then designs the final layout of the database for programmers to code its logic. They also decide which and what data to be stored and what relation among the stored entities of the database.

Fourth, Sophisticated Users. They can be engineers, scientists, business analysts who are very much familiar with databases. They don't write the code for the database but they interact with the database by writing SQL queries directly through the query processor. But important note, they can develop their own database applications as per their requirement.

Firth, System Analyst. They are the one to analyze the requirements of Naive / Parametric End Users. Analyzing feasibility, economics and technical aspects are their major responsibilities. They also shoulder the responsibility to check whether all the requirements of naive users are satisfied or not. They can also update the final layout of the database as per requirements to make sure the final product should meet all the requirements. 

Sixth, Application Programmers. They are also called Back-End Developers. They are computer professionals and software engineers who write the code for the database. Application programmers also have deep knowledge of DBMS and database and they interact using DML queries. They are efficient enough to design or develop their database in any language they know.

Seventh, Casual Users / Temporary Users. They are called casual users since they occasionally use the database services but each time they access the database, they require new information. They also have little knowledge about DBMS.


# During flipped class
It was our first flipped class for DBMS. We were divided into four expert groups with 6 members each. Group 1 and 2 were assigned to discuss the types of  database users and group 3 and 4 to discuss the roles and responsibilities of database administrators. After 15 minutes of discussion, we were again grouped into a home group consisting of different members. Then, we had to teach each other the field we are expert in.That discussion was held for 15 minutes.  We had a round of question and answer sessions for 20 minutes.

# For the betterment of flipped class
Well, I think flipped class is solely for the studentâ€™s sake and I believe it will help us a lot in future sessions. But during group discussions, we use various kinds of websites for research and sometimes to end up getting false information. To address these issues, adjusting the content and format based on our preferences and providing supplementary resources could offer us flexibility in learning.
