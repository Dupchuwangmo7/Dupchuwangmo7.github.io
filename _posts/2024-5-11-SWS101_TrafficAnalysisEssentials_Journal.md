#### Task 2

Network Security

Base Network Security Control Levels:

- Physical : Physical security controls prevent unauthorised physical access to networking devices, cable boards, locks, and all linked components.

- Technical	: Data security controls prevent unauthorised access to network data, like installing tunnels and implementing security layers.

- Administrative : Administrative security controls provide consistency in security operations like creating policies, access levels and authentication processes.

The key elements of Access Control:

- Firewall Protection
- Network Access Control (NAC)
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)	
- Load Balancing	
- Network Segmentation
- Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
- Zero Trust Model	

Managed Security Services

- Network Penetration Testing 	
- Vulnerability Assessment	
- Incident Response
- Behavioural Analysis	

#### Task 3
Traffic Analysis / Network Traffic Analysis
- Traffic Analysis is a method of intercepting, recording/monitoring, and analysing network data and communication patterns to detect and respond to system health issues, network anomalies, and threats. 

Benefits of the Traffic Analysis:

- Provides full network visibility.
- Helps comprehensive baselining for asset tracking.
- Helps to detect/respond to anomalies and threats.
